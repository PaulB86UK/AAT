## Getting ERC-20 token logic from OpenZeppelin
### What I want to do with the token
#### Be able to Buy
#### Be able to Sell
#### Be able to Stake/Unstake




#### Be able to Give Rewards
#### Be Listed in different Dexxs
#### What other nice functionality the ERC-20 Contract Provides???

An ERC20 token contract keeps track of fungible tokens: any one token is exactly equal to any other token; no tokens have special rights or behavior associated with them. This makes ERC20 tokens useful for things like a medium of exchange currency, voting rights, staking, and more.

#### Cantidad de Tokens. Tiene que se un numero especial. Me gusta la idea del tamanio del territorio de la argetina.
